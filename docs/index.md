# About Me
Hello I am Latte! 

I'm a border collie living in Seattle. I was born in 2020, so that makes me... 3 years old now!

Mom and dad say I am super chill. I just don't like small talks. I like to think about bigger, deeper, more philosophical things... like what's for dinner.

I can be very playful once I warm up to you, but first I just need to observe for a while. :P


# Take Care of Me
Thank you for taking care of me when my humans are out of town! I hope we have a great time together.

## Feed 
* 1 cup of dry dog food at noon daily
* [Optional] treats! 
* [Optional] 1 dental stick in the evening. I usually drink a lot after eating the dental stick and want to pee 2-3 hours after.
* [Optional] human food like chicken breast, egg, and shrimp!


## Walk 
I go pee pee and/or poo poo 3 times a day, 7ish hours apart. Usually itâ€™s a good idea to take me out right before bed and right after wakeup. An example schedule that has worked well for my hoomans is 9am, 4pm, and 11pm. 

When I go poo poo on new grass, I might need 5 minutes to smell around and get used to it before I feel comfortable. If I seem reluctant, you can say "Go Pee-Pee" or "Go Poo-Poo" to encourage me.

Sometimes I like to eat grass from streets and gardens because as a Seattle dog I feel like a salad sometimes. Don't mind me if I do that.

## Sleep
I do not climb onto bed or sofa. I usally like to sleep alone so that I can have some privacy at the end of the day, either in my own bed or on the floor. 

When I go to a new place, I do like to sleep closer to hoomans to feel safer.

## Play
I love the outdoors! I like to hike in the mountains or swim in the lake. Mom and Dad take me to run a 5k and hike somewhere between 5 miles to 10 miles almost every week in the summer, and I get suepr excited every time! 

Dog parks are fun too. I like to meet other dog friends, but I secretly think playing fetch is kinda a boring game unless you have treats. 

## Work
I am an aspiring civil engineer. Sometimes I like to dig holes in the garden just to practice.
